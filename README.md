  o Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  o	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  o	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  o	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
